### If you want to set up a dissertation using LaTeX, copy the following files/directories into your own directory:

Chapter-1/, Appendix-A/, Samples/, ckc1.tex, front.tex, ncsuthesis.cls, optional.tex

OBVIOUSLY, the names and content of each of these files will need to be modified. However, with
this set of files, a LaTeX editor with appropriate back-end materials (TexLive distribution, etc.),
and a bit of understanding of how the files tie together, you should be able to very quickly
set up your own dissertation work.

Many of these resources are available at https://grad.ncsu.edu/students/etd/
The 'ncsuthesis.cls', 'optional.tex', and 'front.tex' files are, as I recall, from 
that website


Use of VSCODE/LaTeX Workshop/this document:

Build the project from 'ckc1.tex'... view 'ckc1.pdf' in a separate tab. Changes to other chapters/sections will be updated and presented.
